# Password-Wizard
A password generator. 

## About
I was given started code and told to create a password generator. Through the assistence of an SMU tutor I was able to create a page that will generate a password pased on user input. 

## How it works
The user is given multuiple prompts to answer to create a password just for them. The prompts as the length and what characters the user wants to include. After all propts are answered, a password is generated for the user. 

## Challenges faced
I faced many challenges with this project, such as knowing where to start and and how to organize my thinking. The tutor helped break down each component and how to best tackle each component of the success criteria. 

## Problems with the code
I feel the code is not as DRY as I would like it to be, so I apoligize if it is not the prettiest code.
